#  Salome Onianwa — Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Salome — a plant biology student who stumbled (happily) into cybersecurity. This portfolio is where I document everything I’m learning: the wins, the “oops”, the late-night Wireshark rabbit holes, and all the notes I wish someone handed me when I started.

##  What You'll Find Here
- TryHackMe badge and challenge writeups
- Simple tools/scripts I’m building as I learn Python and bash
- Notes from networking labs and packet sniffing practice
- Blog-style entries on cybersecurity topics I find interesting
- The honest chaos of figuring it all out

This space is a work-in-progress — just like me. Thanks for stopping by 🧃
