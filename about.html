    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I'm Salome Ifeanyi Onianwa â€” a Nigerian student of Plant Biology who accidentally fell in love with cybersecurity. Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work (and sometimes break), which naturally led me down a rabbit hole of routers, packets, and Python.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Iâ€™m currently self-teaching my way through networking and cybersecurity fundamentals while finishing my BSc. Between lectures and lab coats, youâ€™ll find me dissecting traffic in Wireshark, solving TryHackMe rooms, or blogging about what Iâ€™m learning â€” mistakes included.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I care about ethical hacking, digital safety, and making cybersecurity feel more human and less intimidating. I also write for a womenâ€™s rights NGO and sip questionable amounts of coffee while trying to figure out how DNS works.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      My long-term goal? Work in cybersecurity (especially network security or pentesting), stay curious, and make tech spaces more accessible to folks like me.
